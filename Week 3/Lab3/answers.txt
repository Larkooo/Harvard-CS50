sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Since bubble sort has the omega with the least steps, we can find it by fiding the fastest sorting algorithm in a sorted array

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Merge sort is the fastest when dealing with a big amount of numbers. As we know, the difference between merge sort and other algorithms gets bigger when dealing with a large amount of data

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Selection sort is the slowest algorithm when dealing with a sorted list, we can then guess that its selection sort
